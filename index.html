        <p class="aside">He will also occasionally talk about himself in the third person. But you'll get used to it. He did.</p>

        <h3>Learning, leading and collaboration</h3>
        <p>I love to keep discovering, and I also spend much of my time helping others in their learning journey. This includes being part of the leadership team at <a href="https://medium.com/@tropicalchancer/preface-learning-voyages-61327de7f062">Chingu Cohorts</a> (founded by Chance McAllister) and I'm blown away by how rapidly the community is growing and developing each day. It's a great opportunity to give back to something bigger than myself, which I've missed since closing the doors on the Water Street Arts Society, a local artist community space that I started with two good friends in Vancouver, BC.</p>

        <h3>Incrementing a better world</h3>
        <p>Since 2007, I've worked for tech companies with good intentions. GiveMeaning, <a href="http://peergiving.com/">Peer Giving</a>, and <a href="http://chimp.net">Chimp Technology</a> are all in the charitable space, helping people do good through fundraising and engagement, both online and off.</p>

        <p>I've really enjoyed my time with these companies, working in development and design, product management, and user experience research and design. In 2016, I decided to go back to school to study full stack development, and the learning journey hasn't stopped. I'm currently working on various <a href="#projects">personal projects and collaborations.</a></p>

        <h2>Time well spent</h2>
        <p>Here are a few things that I'm working on, or have recently wrapped up:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <div class="project-image"><i class="fa fa-book" aria-hidden="true"></i></div>
            <h3>TinyLib</h3>
            <p>TinyLib (codename) is a community library project, founded by myself and Heath Morris. The primary premise is that people want to better track the books that they lend. We also want to grow a culture of sharing that doesn't rely on the local libraries often strained resources. People will be able to upload and share a catalog of their personal libraries and loan titles to friends.</p>

            <p>Nonprofit Supply Co provides the "equipment for your good journey". They serve nonprofits, equipping them with the ideas, tools, and services needed to get by in our digital world. Brady Josephson and I are working together on the website and brand refactor, as well as exploring the viability of charitable analytics tools.</p>

            <h3>Quiet Please</h3>
            <p>While learning Ruby on Rails I experimented on a number of projects, they're all on Github but I didn't find any of them particularly interesting except for this one. It's a silent auction app for nonprofits to use at fundraising galas. While it still has a long way to go, I enjoyed it immensely, and hope to wrap it up the next time I tackle Ruby again.</p>

            <h3>Corner Store Sheds</h3>
            <p>I took three months or so to scratch an itch and a Shopify e-commerce experiment popped out. Working with Anatoly Spektor, I worked on everything from the paperwork of setting up a business in the United States, to supplier deals, website design and development, branding, social media, copywriting, advertising and sales. The full monty!</p>

            <h3>Ideas Incubator</h3>
            <p>While working with Chingu coders, I've noticed that ideas have not been easy to come by for the build-to-learn projects. As soon as I can free up some time I'm going to build this ideas-ratings app, to give new coders some inspiration and new material beyond the well-practiced to-do app. Est. late summer 2017.</p>
